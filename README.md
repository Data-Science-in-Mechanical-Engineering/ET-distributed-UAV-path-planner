Repo for the simulation environment used in our paper "An event-triggered and distributed model predictive control for guaranteed collision avoidance in UAV swarms".

The script to start a simulation can be found in Projects>DMPCBatchSimulationCaller>dmpc_simulation_caller.py

All parameters are the same as the ones for the results in the paper.

[gym-pybullets-drones](https://github.com/utiasDSL/gym-pybullet-drones) has to be installed to run the simulation.
